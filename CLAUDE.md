## Project: Gather

Privacy-focused event planning app. Users create events, invite people, track RSVPs, and communicate with attendees.

## Specs

All specifications live in `openspec/specs/`. Read `openspec/specs/index.md` for an overview.

## Roadmap

See `openspec/ROADMAP.md` for build sequence. Work is organized into Groups A-J, each containing parallelizable tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite (responsive web app)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Language**: TypeScript (both frontend and backend)

## Key Principles

- Privacy first: minimal data, encryption, no tracking
- Low friction: phone-only signup, passwordless auth
- Organizer empowerment: mass comms, questionnaires, role management
