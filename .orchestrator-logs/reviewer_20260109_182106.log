## Review Summary

### Files Reviewed

**New Files:**
- `backend/src/routes/wall.ts` - Event wall API routes
- `frontend/src/components/EventWall.tsx` - Event wall React component

**Modified Files:**
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added WallPost model
- `backend/src/app.ts` - Registered wall routes
- `frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx` - Integrated EventWall component
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added wall API types and functions

### Issues Found and Fixed
None - the code was well-written with:
- Proper authentication checks
- Input validation (content length, empty content)
- Authorization checks (only confirmed attendees/organizers can access)
- No SQL injection (using Prisma ORM)
- No XSS vulnerabilities (React auto-escapes content)
- Proper error handling with descriptive error codes

### Tests Written

**Backend Tests (`backend/src/__tests__/wall.test.ts`):**
- 20 tests covering:
  - Authentication requirements for GET, POST, DELETE
  - 404 responses for missing events/posts
  - Access control (non-attendees cannot access wall)
  - Content validation (empty, whitespace, too long)
  - Post creation for attendees and organizers
  - Post deletion (only by author)
  - Cross-event post protection

**Frontend Tests (`frontend/src/components/EventWall.test.tsx`):**
- 23 tests covering:
  - Unauthenticated state (login prompt)
  - No access state (RSVP prompt)
  - Loading state
  - Posts display with organizer badges
  - Empty state
  - Error states
  - Character count
  - Post creation
  - Post deletion
  - Relative time formatting

### Test Results
- **Backend:** 86 tests passed
- **Frontend:** 70 tests passed
- **TypeScript:** No errors in backend or frontend

### Remaining Concerns
1. **Minor UX concern**: The frontend uses `alert()` for delete errors (EventWall.tsx:131-134). This works but could be improved with a toast/notification component in the future.

2. **Database constraint**: The WallPost content max length (2000 chars) is enforced at the application level but not at the database level. Could add `@db.VarChar(2000)` to the schema for defense in depth, but the application layer validation is sufficient.
