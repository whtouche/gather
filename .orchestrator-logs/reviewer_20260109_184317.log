All tests pass. Let me provide a summary of the review:

## Review Summary

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Backend Test Mocks Missing** - Added mocks for `moderationLog`, `notification`, and `user` tables in `wall.test.ts`

2. **Mock WallPost Missing New Fields** - Added `isPinned` and `pinnedAt` fields to the mock wall post in tests

3. **Test Case Incorrectly Expected 403 for Organizer Delete** - The existing test expected non-organizers to get 403 when deleting others' posts, but didn't account for the new organizer moderation capability. Updated test to clarify that non-organizers cannot delete others' posts, and added a new test for organizers deleting others' posts.

4. **Frontend Mock Posts Missing New Fields** - Added `isPinned` and `pinnedAt` to all mock WallPost objects in `EventWall.test.tsx`

5. **Frontend API Mocks Missing New Functions** - Added mocks for `pinWallPost`, `unpinWallPost`, and `getModerationLog` in the test file

### Tests Written

  - Requires authentication
  - Returns 404 for non-existent event
  - Returns 403 for non-organizers
  - Returns 404 for non-existent post
  - Returns 400 when trying to pin a reply
  - Returns 400 when post is already pinned
  - Pins a post successfully

- `DELETE /api/events/:id/wall/:postId/pin` - 4 tests
  - Requires authentication
  - Returns 403 for non-organizers

  - Unpins a post successfully

- `GET /api/events/:id/wall/moderation-log` - 4 tests
  - Requires authentication
  - Returns 404 for non-existent event
  - Returns 403 for non-organizers

- Updated `DELETE /api/events/:id/wall/:postId` test to cover organizer delete behavior

**Frontend (38 tests, 10 new):**
- Shows pinned posts with pinned indicator
- Shows pin button for organizers
- Does not show pin button for non-organizers
- Shows moderation log button for organizers
- Does not show moderation log button for non-organizers
- Allows organizer to delete another user's post
- Pins a post when pin button is clicked
- Unpins a post when unpin button is clicked
- Opens moderation log modal when button is clicked

### Code Quality Review

The implementation is solid with:
- Proper authorization checks (organizers only for moderation actions)
- Correct error codes and messages
- Moderation log entries created for all moderation actions
- Notification sent to post author when their post is deleted by moderator
- Proper sorting of pinned posts (pinned first, then by creation time)
- Only top-level posts can be pinned (replies cannot be pinned)
- Clean TypeScript types for all new API functions

### No Critical Issues Found

The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and handles edge cases properly. Security is maintained with proper authentication and authorization checks on all endpoints.
