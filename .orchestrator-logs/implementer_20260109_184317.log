## Summary

I have successfully implemented **E3: Wall Moderation** for the Gather app. Here's what was implemented:

### Database Schema Changes (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `isPinned` (Boolean) and `pinnedAt` (DateTime) fields to `WallPost` model
- Added `POST_DELETED_BY_MODERATOR` to `NotificationType` enum
- Created new `ModerationLog` model to track all moderation actions with:
  - `eventId`, `moderatorId`, `action` (DELETE/PIN/UNPIN)
  - `targetPostId`, `postContent`, `postAuthorId` for audit trail
- Added index for efficient querying of pinned posts

### Backend API Routes (`backend/src/routes/wall.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE** `/api/events/:id/wall/:postId` - Now allows organizers to delete any post (not just their own), creates moderation log entry, and notifies the post author
- **Added POST** `/api/events/:id/wall/:postId/pin` - Allows organizers to pin top-level posts
- **Added DELETE** `/api/events/:id/wall/:postId/pin` - Allows organizers to unpin posts
- **Added GET** `/api/events/:id/wall/moderation-log` - Returns moderation log for organizers
- Updated GET wall posts to sort pinned posts first (by pin time), then by creation time

### Frontend API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- Added `isPinned` and `pinnedAt` fields to `WallPost` interface
- Added `pinWallPost()` and `unpinWallPost()` functions
- Added `getModerationLog()` function and `ModerationLogEntry` interface
- Updated `deleteWallPost()` return type to include `moderatorDeleted` flag

### Frontend UI (`frontend/src/components/EventWall.tsx`)
- Added `isOrganizer` prop to enable moderation features
- Added pin/unpin icons with visual feedback
- Pinned posts display with yellow highlight and "Pinned" badge
- Organizers can delete any post (with "(moderator)" tooltip)
- Added "Moderation Log" button in header for organizers
- Added modal to view moderation history with action details
- Posts re-sort automatically when pinned/unpinned

### EventPage Update (`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx`)
- Now passes `isOrganizer` prop to EventWall component
