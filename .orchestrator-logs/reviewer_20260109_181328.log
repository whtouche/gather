## Review Summary

### Files Reviewed
1. **backend/src/middleware/eventAuth.ts** - New `requireCanShareInvite` middleware and `InviteSharingRequest` interface
2. **backend/src/routes/invitations.ts** - Updated invitation route to use new middleware for attendee invite sharing
3. **frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx** - New "Share This Event" section for confirmed attendees

### Issues Found and Fixed
**No critical issues found.** The code is well-structured with:
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Good error handling with appropriate error codes
- TypeScript types are correctly defined
- Security: No SQL injection, XSS, or other vulnerabilities detected

### Tests Written

**Backend** (`backend/src/__tests__/eventAuth.test.ts`):
- 14 tests for `requireCanShareInvite` middleware:
  - Missing event ID validation
  - Unauthenticated user handling
  - Event not found handling
  - Event creator permission
  - Organizer role permission
  - Invite sharing disabled handling
  - Non-confirmed attendee handling (MAYBE, NO, null RSVP)
  - Confirmed attendee permission when sharing enabled
- 5 tests for `isEventOrganizer` helper function

**Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.test.tsx`):
- 11 tests for EventPage component:
  - Loading state
  - Error state (event not found)
  - Attendee share section visibility conditions:
    - Hidden for non-RSVP'd users
    - Hidden when `allowInviteSharing` is false
    - Visible for confirmed attendees when sharing enabled
    - Hidden for organizers (they have separate controls)
    - Hidden for MAYBE RSVP
    - Hidden for draft events
    - Visible for ongoing events
  - Organizer actions visibility

### Test Results
- **Backend**: 66 tests passed (including 14 new tests)
- **Frontend**: 47 tests passed (including 11 new tests)
- **TypeScript**: Both backend and frontend compile without errors

### No Remaining Concerns
The implementation is solid and follows established patterns in the codebase.
