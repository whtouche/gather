## Summary

I successfully implemented **E2: Wall Interactions** for the Gather app. Here's what was completed:

### Database Changes (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `WallReaction` model for heart/like reactions with unique constraint per user/post
- Extended `WallPost` model with:
  - `parentId` field for reply support (self-referential relation)
  - `depth` field to track nesting level (0 = post, 1 = reply, 2 = reply-to-reply)
  - `reactions` relation to track reactions

### Backend Routes (`backend/src/routes/wall.ts`)
- Updated `GET /:id/wall` to fetch posts with nested replies (2 levels max) and reactions
- Updated `POST /:id/wall` to support creating replies via `parentId` parameter, with:
  - Different max content length for replies (1000 chars) vs posts (2000 chars)
  - Automatic depth calculation with max depth enforcement
- Added `POST /:id/wall/:postId/reactions` to add a heart reaction
- Added `DELETE /:id/wall/:postId/reactions` to remove own reaction

### Frontend API (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- Added `WallReply` interface for nested replies
- Extended `WallPost` interface with `reactionCount`, `userHasReacted`, `replyCount`, and `replies`
- Added `addReaction()` and `removeReaction()` API functions
- Updated `createWallPost()` to accept optional `parentId` for replies

### Frontend Component (`frontend/src/components/EventWall.tsx`)
- Refactored into modular components:
  - `PostItem` - Renders posts/replies with reactions and reply buttons
  - `ReplyForm` - Inline form for submitting replies
  - Icon components (`HeartIcon`, `ReplyIcon`, `TrashIcon`, `SpinnerIcon`)
- Features implemented:
  - Heart/like reactions with toggle (click to add, click again to remove)
  - Reply functionality with max 2-level nesting
  - Real-time reaction count display
  - Reply count display on posts
  - Visual distinction between posts and replies (indentation, smaller avatars)
  - Delete functionality works for both posts and replies

All TypeScript checks pass in both backend and frontend.
