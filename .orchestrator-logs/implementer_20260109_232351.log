Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **G1: Questionnaire Builder** for the Gather app. Here's what was completed:

### Backend Implementation

1. **Database Schema** (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`):
   - Added `QuestionnaireQuestion` model with support for 7 question types:
     - SHORT_TEXT (single line, max 200 chars)
     - LONG_TEXT (paragraph, max 2000 chars)
     - SINGLE_CHOICE (radio buttons, 2-10 options)
     - MULTIPLE_CHOICE (checkboxes, 2-10 options)
     - YES_NO (boolean)
     - NUMBER (integer or decimal)
     - DATE (date picker)
   - Added `QuestionnaireResponse` model for storing attendee answers
   - Included fields for required/optional questions, help text, and ordering

2. **API Routes** (`backend/src/routes/questionnaire.ts`):
   - `GET /api/events/:eventId/questionnaire` - Get all questions for an event
   - `POST /api/events/:eventId/questionnaire` - Create a new question (organizers only)
   - `PATCH /api/events/:eventId/questionnaire/:questionId` - Update a question (organizers only)
   - `DELETE /api/events/:eventId/questionnaire/:questionId` - Delete a question (organizers only)
   - `POST /api/events/:eventId/questionnaire/reorder` - Reorder questions (organizers only)
   - Full validation for all question types and constraints (max lengths, choice counts, etc.)

3. **App Integration** (`backend/src/app.ts`):
   - Registered questionnaire routes in the Express app

### Frontend Implementation

1. **API Client** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
   - Added TypeScript types for `QuestionType`, `QuestionnaireQuestion`, `CreateQuestionInput`, `UpdateQuestionInput`
   - Implemented all API functions: `getQuestionnaire`, `createQuestion`, `updateQuestion`, `deleteQuestion`, `reorderQuestions`

2. **QuestionnaireBuilder Component** (`frontend/src/components/QuestionnaireBuilder.tsx`):
   - Full CRUD interface for managing questionnaire questions
   - Question form with:
     - Question text input (500 char limit)
     - Question type selector with descriptions
     - Dynamic choice editor for single/multiple choice questions (add/remove options)
     - Required/optional toggle
     - Help text input (200 char limit)
   - Questions list showing all questions with order numbers
   - Edit and delete functionality for each question
   - Different views for organizers (full builder) vs attendees (read-only view)

3. **Page Integration**:
   - Added to `EditEventPage.tsx` - Organizers can build questionnaires while editing events
   - Added to `EventPage.tsx` - Visible to all users (organizers can edit, attendees can view)

### Testing

- ✅ Backend TypeScript compilation passes (no new errors)
- ✅ Frontend TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ Prisma schema validation passes

### Features Delivered

All requirements from REQ-INV-019 and REQ-INV-020 have been implemented:
- ✅ Create custom questions for events
- ✅ Multiple question types (text, choice, yes/no, number, date)
- ✅ Mark questions required or optional
- ✅ Add help text to questions
- ✅ Question ordering support
- ✅ Full validation (character limits, choice counts, etc.)

The implementation is ready for the next tasks in Group G (G2: Questionnaire During RSVP, G3: Response Management, G4: Questionnaire Editing).
