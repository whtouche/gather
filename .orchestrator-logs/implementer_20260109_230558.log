Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what I implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **F4: Invite from Previous Attendees** (REQ-INV-025) for the Gather app. This feature allows event organizers to easily invite people from their previous events.

### What Was Implemented

#### Backend (Node.js/Express/TypeScript)

1. **Utility Module** (`backend/src/utils/previousAttendees.ts`):
   - `getPreviousAttendees()` - Retrieves users from events the organizer previously organized or attended
   - `filterPreviousAttendeesByEvent()` - Filters attendees by a specific shared event
   - Only includes users who RSVP'd "YES" to COMPLETED events
   - Returns metadata: last event attended together, number of shared events

2. **API Routes** (`backend/src/routes/previousAttendees.ts`):
   - `GET /api/events/:id/previous-attendees` - List previous attendees with optional filtering
   - `POST /api/events/:id/previous-attendees/invite` - Bulk invite selected users
   - Masks contact information (email/phone) for privacy
   - Automatically uses preferred contact method (email first, then SMS)
   - Prevents duplicate invitations and notifies about existing RSVPs

3. **Integration**:
   - Registered routes in `backend/src/app.ts`
   - Follows existing patterns from mass email/SMS features
   - Uses existing invitation utilities (`createAndSendEmailInvitation`, `createAndSendSmsInvitation`)

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS)

1. **API Client** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
   - Added `PreviousAttendee` interface and related types
   - `getPreviousAttendees()` function with optional event filtering
   - `invitePreviousAttendees()` function for bulk invitations

2. **Modal Component** (`frontend/src/components/PreviousAttendeesModal.tsx`):
   - Browse previous attendees with rich metadata display
   - Shows last event attended together and shared event count
   - Checkbox-based bulk selection with Select All/Clear options
   - Visual indicators for available contact methods (Email/SMS badges)
   - Disabled state for users without contact methods
   - Loading, browse, sending, and results states
   - Detailed results with breakdown of sent/failed/already invited/already RSVP'd

3. **EventPage Integration** (`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx`):
   - Added "Invite from Previous Events" button in Organizer Actions section
   - Styled with teal color scheme to distinguish from other invitation methods
   - Only visible for PUBLISHED or ONGOING events
   - Positioned alongside other mass communication features

### Key Features

✅ **Smart User Discovery**: Finds people from both events you organized AND events you attended  
✅ **Rich Context**: Shows which event you last attended together and total shared events  
✅ **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple people and send all invitations at once  
✅ **Automatic Contact Method**: Uses email if available, falls back to SMS  
✅ **Privacy-First**: Contact details are masked in all responses  
✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing invitations and RSVPs  
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Detailed results showing exactly what happened with each invitation  

### TypeScript Compliance

- ✅ Backend: No TypeScript errors in production code
- ✅ Frontend: No TypeScript errors

All code follows existing patterns and conventions from the codebase, particularly the mass email/SMS communication features.
