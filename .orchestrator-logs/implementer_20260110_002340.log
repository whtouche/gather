Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **I1: Notification Preferences** for the Gather app. Here's what was completed:

### Database Changes
- Added four global notification preference fields to the `User` model:
  - `emailNotifications` (default: true)
  - `smsNotifications` (default: true)
  - `wallActivityNotifications` (default: true)
  - `connectionEventNotifications` (default: true)
- Created new `EventNotificationSetting` model for per-event notification preferences with:
  - `muteAll` - mute all notifications for a specific event
  - `muteWallOnly` - mute only wall activity notifications for a specific event

### Backend API (backend/src/routes/profile.ts)
- Updated `GET /api/profile` to include notification preferences in response
- Updated `PATCH /api/profile` to accept and validate notification preference updates
- Added `GET /api/profile/events/:eventId/notifications` to retrieve per-event settings
- Added `PATCH /api/profile/events/:eventId/notifications` to update per-event settings
- Proper authorization: per-event settings only accessible to event attendees

### Frontend Changes

**API Service (frontend/src/services/api.ts)**
- Updated `UserProfile` interface with notification preference fields
- Updated `UpdateProfileInput` interface to support notification updates
- Added `EventNotificationSettings` interface and related types
- Added `getEventNotificationSettings()` and `updateEventNotificationSettings()` API functions

**Profile Page (frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx)**
- Added Notification Preferences section with checkboxes for:
  - Email Notifications
  - SMS Notifications
  - Wall Activity Notifications
  - New Event Notifications from Connections
- All settings save together with other profile changes
- Clear descriptions for each notification type

**Event Notification Settings Component (frontend/src/components/EventNotificationSettings.tsx)**
- New standalone component for per-event notification controls
- Shows "Mute all notifications" toggle
- Shows "Mute wall notifications only" toggle (disabled when all muted)
- Auto-hides if user is not an event attendee
- Real-time save with success/error feedback
- Integrated into EventPage for logged-in attendees

### Quality Assurance
- All TypeScript checks pass on both backend and frontend
- Prisma client successfully generated with new schema
- No regressions in existing code
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

The implementation provides users with comprehensive control over their notification preferences at both global and per-event levels, exactly as specified in REQ-MSG-016 and REQ-MSG-017.
