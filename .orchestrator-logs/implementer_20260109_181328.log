## Summary

I implemented **D4: Event Privacy Settings** which completes Group D (Communication Station).

### What was implemented:

**Backend Changes (`backend/src/middleware/eventAuth.ts`):**
- Added new `InviteSharingRequest` interface
- Added new `requireCanShareInvite` middleware that allows:
  - Organizers to always share invite links
  - Confirmed attendees (RSVP YES) to share invite links when `allowInviteSharing` is enabled on the event

**Backend Changes (`backend/src/routes/invitations.ts`):**
- Updated the `POST /api/events/:id/invitations` endpoint to use the new `requireCanShareInvite` middleware instead of `requireEventOrganizer`
- This allows confirmed attendees to generate shareable invite links when the event's `allowInviteSharing` setting is true

**Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx`):**
- Added a "Share This Event" section that shows for non-organizer users who:
  - Have RSVP'd "YES" (confirmed attendees)
  - Are viewing an event where `allowInviteSharing` is true
  - The event is in "PUBLISHED" or "ONGOING" state

### Pre-existing functionality that was already in place:
- Database schema already had `attendeeListVisibility` and `allowInviteSharing` fields
- CreateEventPage and EditEventPage already had the privacy settings UI
- The attendee list endpoint already respected `attendeeListVisibility` (showing full list to attendees only when set to `ATTENDEES_ONLY`, otherwise only to organizers)

### TypeScript checks:
- Both backend and frontend pass TypeScript checks with no errors
