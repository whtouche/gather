Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **I2: Event Search & Filter** feature for the Gather app. Here's what was delivered:

### Backend Implementation

**New API Endpoint** (`/api/dashboard/search` - GET):
- **Search Parameters**:
  - `title`: Text search (case-insensitive, partial match)
  - `startDate`: Filter events starting on or after this date
  - `endDate`: Filter events starting on or before this date
  - `state`: Filter by event state category (upcoming, past, cancelled)
  - `role`: Filter by user's role (organizer, attendee)
  - `page`: Page number for pagination (default: 1)
  - `limit`: Results per page (default: 20, max: 100)

- **Response**: Returns paginated event results with full pagination metadata

**Location**: `backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts:522-736`

### Frontend Implementation

1. **EventSearchFilter Component** - Collapsible search and filter UI
   - Always-visible search bar with title search
   - Expandable advanced filters section with:
     - Date range picker (start/end dates)
     - Event status dropdown (all, upcoming, past, cancelled)
     - Role filter dropdown (all, organizer, attendee)
   - Visual indicator showing number of active filters
   - Clear button to reset all filters
   - Location: `frontend/src/components/EventSearchFilter.tsx`

2. **EventSearchPage** - Dedicated search page
   - Full-featured search interface with filter controls
   - Results displayed in responsive grid layout
   - Pagination controls with smart page number display
   - Loading skeletons and error states
   - Empty state when no results found
   - Shows result count and range (e.g., "Showing 1-20 of 45")
   - Location: `frontend/src/pages/EventSearchPage.tsx`

3. **API Service Updates**
   - Added `searchEvents()` function
   - New TypeScript interfaces: `EventSearchFilters`, `SearchEvent`, `EventSearchResponse`
   - Location: `frontend/src/services/api.ts:198-253`

4. **Navigation Integration**
   - Added route `/events/search` to App.tsx
   - Added "Search" button to dashboard header for easy access
   - Location: `frontend/src/App.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

### Technical Details

- All TypeScript checks pass (both frontend and backend)
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Implements REQ-EVT-019 specification requirements
- Pagination included as specified
- Supports all required filter types from the spec

The implementation is complete, tested with TypeScript, and ready for use. Users can now easily search and filter their events from the dashboard using the new Search button.
