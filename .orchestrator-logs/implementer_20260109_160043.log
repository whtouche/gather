## Summary

I have implemented **D1: Email Invitations** for the Gather app. Here's what was added:

### Backend Changes

1. **Database Schema** (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`):
   - Added `EmailInvitation` model to track email invitations with fields for recipient email, name, and status tracking (PENDING, SENT, OPENED, RSVPD, FAILED)
   - Added `EmailInvitationStatus` enum
   - Added relation from `InviteLink` to `EmailInvitation`
   - Added relation from `Event` to `EmailInvitation[]`

2. **Email Service Utility** (`backend/src/utils/email.ts`):
   - `sendInvitationEmail()` - Sends email invitation (currently logs to console, ready for provider integration)
   - `createAndSendEmailInvitation()` - Creates invite link, email invitation record, and sends email
   - `markEmailInvitationOpened()` - Tracks when email recipient opens the invite link
   - `markEmailInvitationRsvpd()` - Tracks when recipient RSVPs
   - `getEmailInvitationStats()` - Gets aggregate statistics for an event
   - `maskEmail()` - Masks email addresses for privacy display

3. **API Routes** (`backend/src/routes/invitations.ts`):
   - `POST /api/events/:id/invitations/email` - Send email invitations to recipients (organizers only)
   - `GET /api/events/:id/invitations/email` - Get email invitation list and stats (organizers only)
   - Updated `GET /api/invitations/:token` to mark email as opened when viewed

### Frontend Changes

1. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
   - Added types for email invitations
   - Added `sendEmailInvitations()` and `getEmailInvitations()` functions

2. **EmailInviteModal** (`frontend/src/components/EmailInviteModal.tsx`):
   - Modal for organizers to input email addresses
   - Supports multiple formats: `email@example.com`, `Name <email@example.com>`, `email, name`
   - Shows sending progress and results

3. **EmailInvitationsPanel** (`frontend/src/components/EmailInvitationsPanel.tsx`):
   - Panel showing email invitation list and statistics
   - Displays sent/opened/RSVP'd status for each invitation
   - Shows aggregate stats (total, sent, opened, RSVP'd, failed)

4. **EventPage** (`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx`):
   - Added "Send Email Invites" button in organizer actions
   - Added EmailInvitationsPanel below organizer actions
   - Added EmailInviteModal integration

### Features Implemented

- Send invitations via email (multiple recipients at once)
- Unique invitation link per recipient
- Event details included in email body
- Track sent/opened/RSVP'd status
- Email masking for privacy (e.g., `jo***@example.com`)
- Prevents duplicate invitations to same email
