## Review Summary

### Files Reviewed
- `backend/src/routes/wall.ts` - Event Wall API routes
- `frontend/src/components/EventWall.tsx` - Event Wall UI component  
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - API client functions
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema for WallPost and WallReaction

### Code Quality Assessment

**Backend (`wall.ts`)**:
- Clean, well-structured code with proper TypeScript types
- Good security practices:
  - Authentication via `requireAuth` middleware on all routes
  - Authorization checks (only confirmed attendees/organizers can access)
  - Input validation (content length limits, empty content checks)
  - Event/Post ownership verification before operations
- No SQL injection risks (using Prisma ORM)
- Proper error handling with descriptive error codes

**Frontend (`EventWall.tsx`)**:
- Well-organized component structure with separated sub-components
- Proper state management for loading, error, and data states
- Good user feedback (loading spinners, error messages)
- Recursive reply handling for nested comments

**API Client (`api.ts`)**:
- Clean type definitions for Wall types
- Proper API functions for all wall operations

**Schema (`schema.prisma`)**:
- Proper relationships and indexes for WallPost and WallReaction
- Depth tracking for reply nesting limits

### Issues Found and Fixed
None - the code was well-written with no critical issues.

### Tests Written/Updated

**Backend** (`backend/src/__tests__/wall.test.ts`):
- Added `wallReaction` mocks to the Prisma mock
- Added complete test coverage for reaction endpoints:
  - `POST /api/events/:id/wall/:postId/reactions` - 6 test cases
  - `DELETE /api/events/:id/wall/:postId/reactions` - 5 test cases
- Updated `mockWallPost` to include required fields for nested data

**Frontend** (`frontend/src/components/EventWall.test.tsx`):
- Added `addReaction` and `removeReaction` to API mocks
- Updated `mockPosts` to include reaction and reply fields
- Added new test sections:
  - **Reactions**: 3 tests for displaying counts, adding, and removing reactions
  - **Replies**: 3 tests for displaying replies, counts, and reply forms
- Fixed delete button selector to match component (`"Delete"` instead of `"Delete post"`)
- Fixed tests that found multiple elements due to nested replies

### Test Results
- **Backend**: 97 tests passing (all wall tests green)
- **Frontend**: 76 tests passing (all EventWall tests green)
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors in either frontend or backend

### Remaining Concerns
None - the feature implementation is solid and well-tested.
