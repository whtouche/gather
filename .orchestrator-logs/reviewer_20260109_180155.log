No hardcoded secrets found - all token usages are for dynamic token generation or retrieval.

## Summary

I've completed a thorough review of the changes in the Gather app. Here's a summary:

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Frontend Test Fix** (`frontend/src/components/SmsInvitationsPanel.test.tsx:172-195`)
   - The test was using `getByText("Sent")` which matched multiple elements
   - Fixed by using `getAllByText()` and checking for existence of elements with status badge styling

2. **Backend Test Fixes** (`backend/src/__tests__/sms.test.ts` and `backend/src/__tests__/smsInvitations.test.ts`)
   - Tests were failing because they imported modules that initialize PrismaClient without DATABASE_URL
   - Fixed by adding proper `vi.mock()` calls to mock the database module before imports

### Tests Written

1. **Profile Routes Tests** (`backend/src/__tests__/profile.test.ts`)
   - Tests for authentication requirements on GET/PATCH /api/profile
   - Tests for public access to GET /api/users/:id

### Code Review Summary

**Backend Changes:**
- **Schema**: Well-structured models for SMS invitations (SmsInvitation, SmsQuota) and profile visibility settings
- **Routes**: Proper authentication middleware, input validation, and error handling
- **SMS Utils**: Good rate limiting implementation, proper phone number masking for privacy

**Frontend Changes:**
- **Components**: Clean React components with proper TypeScript typing
- **API Service**: Properly typed API functions for SMS and profile functionality
- **Pages**: Profile and UserProfilePage handle loading/error states correctly

**Security Review:**
- No XSS vulnerabilities (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML or innerHTML usage)
- No SQL injection risks (using Prisma ORM with parameterized queries)
- No hardcoded secrets
- Proper input validation on both frontend and backend
- Phone/email masking for privacy protection
- Rate limiting for SMS invitations

### Test Results

All tests pass:
- **Backend**: 52 tests passed (verification, eventState, sms, smsInvitations, profile)
- **Frontend**: 36 tests passed (api, EventCard, SmsInvitationsPanel)
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors in either frontend or backend

### Remaining Notes

The code is well-structured and follows good practices. The double mounting of profile routes in `app.ts` is intentional and necessary to expose both `/api/profile` endpoints and `/api/users/:id` endpoint.
