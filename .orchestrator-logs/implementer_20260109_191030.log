## Summary

I have successfully implemented **F1: Mass Email Communication** for the Gather app. Here's what was implemented:

### Database Changes (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `MassCommunication` model - stores mass email messages with subject, body, target audience, and delivery statistics
- Added `MassCommunicationRecipient` model - tracks individual recipient delivery status
- Added `MassCommunicationQuota` model - enforces rate limits (5 emails/week, 24h between sends)
- Added new enums: `CommunicationType`, `TargetAudience`, `ContactMethod`, `DeliveryStatus`
- Added relations to `User` and `Event` models

### Backend Implementation
- **`backend/src/utils/massEmail.ts`** - Utility functions for:
  - Sending mass emails (logs to console, production-ready structure)
  - Quota checking and enforcement (REQ-MSG-014)
  - Getting recipients by target audience (ALL, YES_ONLY, MAYBE_ONLY, NO_ONLY, WAITLIST_ONLY)
  - Communication history retrieval
  
- **`backend/src/routes/messages.ts`** - API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/events/:id/messages/email/quota` - Check quota status
  - `GET /api/events/:id/messages/email/preview` - Preview recipients for audience
  - `POST /api/events/:id/messages/email` - Send mass email
  - `GET /api/events/:id/messages/email/history` - Get communication history
  - `GET /api/events/:id/messages/email/:messageId` - Get message details

- Registered routes in `backend/src/app.ts`

### Frontend Implementation
- **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`** - Added API functions and types for mass email operations

- **`frontend/src/components/MassEmailModal.tsx`** - Modal component for composing and sending mass emails:
  - Quota display with progress bar
  - Target audience selection with descriptions
  - Subject (200 char limit) and body (10,000 char limit) inputs
  - Preview step showing recipient count and sample
  - Sending progress and results display

- **`frontend/src/components/MassEmailHistoryPanel.tsx`** - Panel showing:
  - List of past mass communications
  - Expandable details with message preview and stats
  - Quota remaining indicator

- **`frontend/src/pages/EventPage.tsx`** - Integrated:
  - "Send Mass Email" button in organizer actions
  - Mass Email History Panel in organizer section
  - Modal with refresh mechanism

### Features Implemented (per REQ-MSG-011, REQ-MSG-013, REQ-MSG-014, REQ-MSG-015)
- Compose mass emails with subject and body
- Target specific audiences (All RSVP'd, Yes only, Maybe only, No only, Waitlist only)
