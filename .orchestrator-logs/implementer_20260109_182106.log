I have successfully implemented **E1: Event Wall (Basic)**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

### Database Schema
- Added `WallPost` model to Prisma schema with:
  - `id`, `eventId`, `authorId`, `content`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  - Relations to `Event` and `User` models
  - Indexes for efficient queries

### Backend API (`backend/src/routes/wall.ts`)
- **GET /api/events/:id/wall** - Get wall posts for an event
  - Only accessible by confirmed attendees (RSVP YES) or organizers
  - Returns posts in reverse chronological order (newest first)
  - Includes author info with organizer badge
  
- **POST /api/events/:id/wall** - Create a new wall post
  - Content validation (1-2000 characters)
  - Only confirmed attendees or organizers can post
  
- **DELETE /api/events/:id/wall/:postId** - Delete a wall post
  - Only the author can delete their own post

### Frontend
- Added wall API functions to `frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
  - `getWallPosts()`, `createWallPost()`, `deleteWallPost()`
  - TypeScript types for `WallPost`, `WallPostAuthor`, etc.

- Created `frontend/src/components/EventWall.tsx`:
  - Post creation form with character counter (max 2000)
  - Posts displayed with author photo, name, organizer badge
  - Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")
  - Delete button for own posts
  - Access control UI (locked message for non-attendees)

- Integrated into `EventPage.tsx`:
  - Wall shown for non-draft, non-cancelled events
  - Refreshes on RSVP change

### Features Implemented
- Wall access control (confirmed attendees only)
- Create text posts (max 2000 characters)
- Display posts with author, timestamp, role badge
- Chronological post feed (newest first)
- Delete own posts
