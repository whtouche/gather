Perfect! Let me create a summary of the review:

## Code Review Summary for Connections Feature

### Overview
Reviewed implementation of the "Connections" feature (Group H1) which allows users to view people they've attended events with.

### Files Reviewed

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/routes/connections.ts` (new file)
- `backend/src/app.ts` (route registration)

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/pages/ConnectionsPage.tsx` (new file)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (API types and functions)
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (routing)
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` (navigation link)

### Issues Found and Fixed

**None - No critical issues found!** The code is production-ready.

#### Code Quality Assessment:
✅ **Security**: No SQL injection (using Prisma ORM), no XSS vulnerabilities, proper authentication middleware  
✅ **TypeScript**: All types properly defined, no type errors  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks, proper error responses  
✅ **Code Structure**: Clean separation of concerns, well-documented  
✅ **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing via Prisma  

### Tests Written

#### Backend Tests (`backend/src/__tests__/connections.test.ts`)
Created comprehensive test suite with 8 tests covering:
- Authentication requirements (2 tests)
- Empty state handling
- Connection data retrieval and transformation
- User exclusion logic
- RSVP filtering (YES responses only)
- Sorting by most recent event
- Error handling

**Result**: All 8 tests passing ✅

#### Frontend Tests (`frontend/src/pages/ConnectionsPage.test.tsx`)
Created comprehensive test suite with 23 tests covering:
- Loading states (1 test)
- Success states (8 tests):
  - Data display
  - Connection count
  - Event count (singular/plural)
  - Event information
  - Profile links
  - Photo display
  - Date formatting
- Empty state (2 tests)
- Error states (3 tests)
- Header elements (3 tests)
- Text pluralization (2 tests)
- Sorting description (1 test)

**Result**: All 23 tests passing ✅

### TypeScript Compilation

**Backend**: ✅ Passes (pre-existing errors in waitlist.test.ts not related to this feature)  
**Frontend**: ✅ Passes with no errors

### Test Execution

**Backend**: 
```
✓ 8/8 tests passing
Duration: 411ms
```

**Frontend**:
```
✓ 23/23 tests passing  
Duration: 683ms
```

### Code Highlights

**Well-implemented features:**
1. **Efficient data aggregation**: Uses Map to deduplicate connections and aggregate shared events
2. **Proper sorting**: Connections sorted by most recent shared event date
3. **Privacy-compliant**: Only shows connections from completed events where both users RSVP'd YES
4. **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly UI with Tailwind CSS
5. **Loading states**: Skeleton loaders for better UX
6. **Error handling**: Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
7. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper alt text, keyboard navigation

### Remaining Concerns

**None.** The implementation is solid and ready for deployment.

### Recommendations

The code follows all project best practices and is ready to merge. No changes recommended.
