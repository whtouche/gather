Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary: H1 Event Connections Implementation

I have successfully implemented **H1: Event Connections** from the roadmap. Here's what was completed:

### Backend Implementation

1. **API Endpoint** (`backend/src/routes/connections.ts`):
   - Created `GET /api/connections` endpoint
   - Returns list of users who have attended completed events together
   - Computes connections from existing RSVP data (users who both RSVP'd "YES" to completed events)
   - Includes for each connection:
     - User's display name
     - Profile photo (if set)
     - Number of shared events
     - Most recent shared event name and date
   - Sorted by most recent event together (default)

2. **Route Registration** (`backend/src/app.ts`):
   - Registered connections routes at `/api/connections`

### Frontend Implementation

1. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
   - Added `Connection` and `ConnectionsResponse` TypeScript interfaces
   - Created `getConnections()` function to fetch connections from API

2. **Connections Page** (`frontend/src/pages/ConnectionsPage.tsx`):
   - Full-featured page displaying all connections
   - Connection cards showing:
     - Profile photo or avatar placeholder
     - Display name
     - Number of shared events
     - Most recent event title and date
   - Loading states with skeleton screens
   - Empty state when user has no connections yet
   - Error handling with retry functionality
   - Clean, responsive UI matching existing design patterns

3. **Routing** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`):
   - Added `/connections` route

4. **Navigation** (`frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`):
   - Added "Connections" button in dashboard header
   - Uses people/users icon for visual consistency

### Technical Details

- **No database schema changes needed**: Connections are computed from existing RSVP and Event data
- **Connection criteria** (per REQ-SOC-002): Two users are connected if both RSVP'd "YES" to the same event AND the event reached "COMPLETED" state
- **Privacy-aware**: Only shows connections after events are completed
- **TypeScript**: All code passes TypeScript type checking with no errors
- **Follows existing patterns**: Code structure matches established conventions in the codebase

### Files Modified/Created

**Backend:**
- Created: `backend/src/routes/connections.ts`
- Modified: `backend/src/app.ts`

**Frontend:**
- Created: `frontend/src/pages/ConnectionsPage.tsx`
- Modified: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Modified: `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Modified: `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

**Documentation:**
- Modified: `openspec/ROADMAP.md` (marked H1 as DONE)

The implementation is complete, tested with TypeScript, and ready for use. Users can now view their connections from the dashboard and see everyone they've attended events with.
