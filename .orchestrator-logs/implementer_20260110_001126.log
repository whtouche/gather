Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **H2: Connection Details** from Group H of the roadmap. Here's what was delivered:

### Backend Implementation (backend/src/routes/connections.ts)

1. **New Endpoint: GET /api/connections/:userId**
   - Retrieves detailed information about a specific connection
   - Shows shared event history (all completed events both users attended)
   - Displays user's role in each event (ORGANIZER or ATTENDEE)
   - Respects privacy settings (shows bio, location, photo only if privacy allows)
   - Returns 404 if no connection exists

2. **Enhanced Endpoint: GET /api/connections**
   - Added filtering support:
     - Filter by name (case-insensitive search)
     - Filter by specific event
     - Filter by date range (startDate/endDate)
   - Added sorting options:
     - Most recent event together (default)
     - Most events together (frequency)
     - Alphabetical by name

### Frontend Implementation

1. **New Page: ConnectionDetailPage.tsx** (frontend/src/pages/ConnectionDetailPage.tsx)
   - Displays connection's profile information (photo, name, bio, location)
   - Shows total count of shared events
   - Lists all shared events with:
     - Event title, date, location
     - User's role badge if they were an organizer
     - Links to event detail pages
   - Filter controls:
     - Filter by specific event
     - Filter by date range
     - Active filter badges with easy removal
   - Responsive design with loading and error states

2. **Enhanced Page: ConnectionsPage.tsx**
   - Added FilterSortBar component with:
     - Sort selector (always visible)
     - Collapsible filter section
     - Name search
     - Date range filters
     - Active filter badges
   - Updated to use new API with filters
   - Changed connection card links to navigate to /connections/:userId instead of /users/:userId
   - Dynamic sort description updates

3. **API Service Updates** (frontend/src/services/api.ts)
   - Added types: `SharedEvent`, `ConnectionDetail`, `ConnectionDetailResponse`, `ConnectionsFilters`, `ConnectionDetailFilters`
   - Updated `getConnections()` to accept optional filters
   - Added `getConnectionDetail()` function

4. **Routing** (frontend/src/App.tsx)
   - Added route: `/connections/:userId` → ConnectionDetailPage

### TypeScript Checks
- Backend: No new TypeScript errors (pre-existing errors in waitlist tests are unrelated)
- Frontend: All TypeScript checks pass ✓

### Adherence to Specifications
All requirements from REQ-SOC-003, REQ-SOC-004, and REQ-SOC-005 have been implemented:
- ✓ View shared event history with connections
- ✓ Access public profile information (respecting privacy settings)
- ✓ Filter by event, date range, and name
- ✓ Sort by recency, frequency, and alphabetically

The implementation is ready for testing and follows all existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase.
